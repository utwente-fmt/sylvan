/**
 * Sylvan: parallel BDD/ListDD package.
 *
 * This is a multi-core implementation of BDDs with complement edges.
 *
 * This package requires parallel the work-stealing framework Lace.
 * Lace must be initialized before initializing Sylvan
 *
 * This package uses explicit referencing.
 * Use sylvan_ref and sylvan_deref to manage external references.
 *
 * Garbage collection requires all workers to cooperate. Garbage collection is either initiated
 * by the user (calling sylvan_gc) or when the nodes table is full. All Sylvan operations
 * check whether they need to cooperate on garbage collection. Garbage collection cannot occur
 * otherwise. This means that it is perfectly fine to do this:
 *              BDD a = sylvan_ref(sylvan_and(b, c));
 * since it is not possible that garbage collection occurs between the two calls.
 *
 * To temporarily disable garbage collection, use sylvan_gc_disable() and sylvan_gc_enable().
