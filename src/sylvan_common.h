/**
 * GARBAGE COLLECTION
 *
 * Garbage collection is performed in a new Lace frame, interrupting all ongoing work
 * until garbage collection is completed.
 *
 * By default, garbage collection is triggered when no new nodes can be added to the nodes table.
 * This is detected when there are no more available buckets in the bounded probe sequence.
 * Garbage collection can also be triggered manually with sylvan_gc()
 *
 * Garbage collection procedure:
 * 1) All installed pre_gc hooks are called.
 *    See sylvan_gc_hook_pre to add hooks.
 * 2) The operation cache is cleared.
 * 3) The nodes table (data part) is cleared.
 * 4) All nodes are marked (to be rehashed) using the various marking callbacks.
 *    See sylvan_gc_add_mark to add marking callbacks.
 *    Afterwards, the ondead hook is called for all now-dead nodes with the custom flag set.
 * 5) The main gc hook is called. The function of this hook is to perform resizing.
 *    The default implementation doubles the nodes table and operation cache sizes.
 *    See sylvan_gc_hook_main to set the hook.
 * 5) The nodes table (hash part) is cleared.
 * 6) All marked nodes are rehashed.
 * 7) All installed post_gc hooks are called.
 *    See sylvan_gc_hook_post to add hooks.
 *
 * For parts of the garbage collection process, specific methods exist.
 * - sylvan_clear_cache() clears the operation cache (step 2)
 * - sylvan_clear_and_mark() performs steps 3 and 4.
 * - sylvan_rehash_all() performs steps 5 and 6.
